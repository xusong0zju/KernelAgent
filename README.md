# KernelAgent — Multi‑Agent GPU Kernel Synthesis and Optimization

KernelAgent turns PyTorch programs into verified Triton kernels and optimize its performance. It was designed around KernelBench workloads and combines:

- Static problem analysis to decide whether to run a lightweight path or a full pipeline
- LLM‑assisted refactoring that isolates fusable subgraphs
- Parallel Triton kernel generation with strict runtime verification
- End‑to‑end composition that rebuilds the original forward pass using only the synthesized kernels
- Hardware‑guided optimization pipeline that iteratively improves performance

## Kernel Generation Pipeline Overview

![](./assets/kernelagent2.excalidraw.svg)

Every stage writes artifacts to a run directory under `.fuse/<run_id>/`, including the fused PyTorch code, `subgraphs.json`, individual KernelAgent sessions, and the final `compose_out/composed_kernel.py`.

Every stage writes artifacts to a run directory under `.optimize/<run_id>/`, including the input Triton kernel, artifacts, individual optimization worker sessions, and the final `output/best_kernel.py`.


## Quickstart

### Requirements
- Python 3.8 – 3.12
- Linux or macOS
- **GPU Requirements (one of the following):**
  - **CUDA**: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
  - **XPU**: Intel GPU with oneAPI support (Arc, Data Center GPUs, or integrated Xe graphics)
- Triton (installed separately: `pip install triton` or nightly from source)
- PyTorch (https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
- LLM provider ([OpenAI](https://openai.com/api/), [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/), or a self-hosted relay)

### Install
```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Platform-Specific PyTorch Installation

#### Intel XPU (Intel GPUs)
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/xpu
```

**Note:** Intel XPU support requires:
- Compatible Intel GPU (Arc series, Data Center GPUs, or integrated Xe graphics)
- Linux with appropriate Intel GPU drivers

Verify your XPU installation:
```python
import torch
print(torch.xpu.is_available())  # Should print True
print(torch.xpu.device_count())  # Number of Intel GPUs
```

#### (Optional) Install KernelBench for problem examples
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ScalingIntelligence/KernelBench.git
```
Note: By default, KernelAgent UI searches for KernelBench at the same level as `KernelAgent`. (i.e. `../KernelBench`)

### Configure
You can export keys directly or use an `.env` file that the CLIs load automatically.

```bash
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5            # default model for extraction
NUM_KERNEL_SEEDS=4            # parallel workers per kernel
MAX_REFINEMENT_ROUNDS=10      # retry budget per worker
LOG_LEVEL=INFO                # logging level
```

#### LLM Providers
KernelAgent currently supports OpenAI and Anthropic out-of-the-box. You can also use a custom OpenAI endpoint.
These can be configured in `.env` or via environment variables.
```bash
# OpenAI (models like `o4-mini`, `gpt-5`)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Anthropic (default; `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` is used when `OPENAI_MODEL` is unset)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# Relay configuration for self-hosted gateways
LLM_RELAY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434
LLM_RELAY_TIMEOUT_S=120
```

#### Anthropic-compatible gateways (e.g. DeepSeek-V4-Pro via KingCloud kspmas)
You can point the Anthropic provider at a third-party Anthropic-compatible
gateway by setting `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` + `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` instead of
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. The `anthropic` SDK reads these env vars itself, so no
code change is needed — just register the model name in
`utils/providers/available_models.py` and select it with `OPENAI_MODEL`.
```bash
ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=<token>
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://kspmas.ksyun.com   # gateway ROOT; the SDK appends /v1/messages
OPENAI_MODEL=deepseek-v4-pro                   # registered name; do NOT add a "[1m]" suffix
```
Reasoning models that prepend a `thinking` block (e.g. DeepSeek-V4-Pro) are
handled — the provider returns the first `text` block.

More knobs live in `triton_kernel_agent/agent.py` and `Fuser/config.py`.

## End-to-End Kernel Generation Workflows

- **Auto-route a KernelBench problem** — static analysis picks between the direct KernelAgent path and the full Fuser pipeline, with automatic fallback if the first attempt fails:
  ```bash
  python -m Fuser.auto_agent \
    --problem /abs/path/to/KernelBench/level1/19_ReLU.py \
    --no-router-cache \     # avoid caching or using cached results
    --verify                # ensure final composition test runs
  ```
  `--no-router-cache` can be enabled to avoid utilizing any cached router results and prevent writing to the cache.

- **Manually run the pipeline (extract → dispatch → compose)** when you want explicit control over models or concurrency:
  ```bash
  python -m Fuser.pipeline \
    --problem /abs/path/to/problem.py \
    --extract-model gpt-5 \
    --dispatch-model o4-mini \
    --dispatch-jobs auto \
    --compose-model o4-mini \
    --workers 4 \
    --max-iters 5 \
    --verify

  # For Intel XPU
  python -m Fuser.pipeline \
    --problem /abs/path/to/problem.py \
    --target-platform xpu \
    --extract-model gpt-5 \
    --dispatch-model o4-mini \
    --dispatch-jobs auto \
    --compose-model o4-mini \
    --workers 4 \
    --max-iters 5 \
    --verify

  ```
  `dispatch-jobs auto` matches the number of discovered subgraphs; artifacts are placed under `.fuse/<run_id>/`.

- **Direct KernelAgent run** — bypass Fuser and provide a plain language problem description or a KernelBench snippet:
  ```python
  from triton_kernel_agent import TritonKernelAgent

  agent = TritonKernelAgent(num_workers=4, max_rounds=8, model_name="gpt-5")
  result = agent.generate_kernel(
      problem_description="Implement ReLU over a contiguous 1D tensor of length 1024"
  )

  if result["success"]:
      print("Kernel path:", result["kernel_path"])
      print("Session directory:", result["session_dir"])
  else:
      print("Failure:", result["message"])
  ```

- **UIs** — interactive runs with Gradio frontends:
  - Triton KernelAgent UI: `kernel-agent` or `python scripts/triton_ui.py`
  - Fuser orchestration UI: `fuser-ui` or `python scripts/fuser_ui`
  - Full pipeline UI: `pipeline-ui` or `python scripts/pipeline_ui`

## Component Details

- **AutoRouter (`Fuser/auto_agent.py`)**: parses the problem’s AST, looks for attention blocks, transposed convolutions, control flow, and long op chains. It caches decisions under `.fuse/router_cache.json` and can fall back to the other path if the first attempt fails. Use  `--no-router-cache` to ignore the existing cache and caching new routes. Use `--ignore-router-config` to ignore router-provided tuning and rely on CLI args.

- **Fuser Orchestrator (`Fuser/orchestrator.py`)**: rewrites the PyTorch module into fusable modules, executes them for validation, and packages a tarball of the fused code. Run IDs and directories are managed via `Fuser/paths.py`.

- **Subgraph Extractor (`Fuser/subgraph_extractor.py`)**: prompts the LLM to emit a JSON array describing each unique subgraph, including ops, shapes, dtypes, and parameter tensors. Entries are deduplicated by shape signature so the dispatcher can reuse kernels.

- **Dispatcher (`Fuser/dispatch_kernel_agent.py`)**: converts each JSON item into a precise Triton generation spec, then spins up `TritonKernelAgent` processes in parallel. Each worker writes its own session directory with the candidate kernel, test harness, and verification logs.

- **TritonKernelAgent (`triton_kernel_agent/`)**: manages a pool of verification workers (`worker.py`, `manager.py`). Each worker iteratively asks an LLM for improvements, executes unit tests under sandboxed subprocesses (`Fuser/runner.py`), and enforces strict bans on PyTorch fallbacks. A run succeeds only when the test prints `PASS` (or the sentinel string) and exits with status 0.

- **Composer (`Fuser/compose_end_to_end.py`)**: stitches the verified kernels back into a single Triton program. The composed file contains one or more `@triton.jit` kernels plus a `kernel_function(...)` wrapper and a self-test that replays the original PyTorch problem. With `--verify`, the test is executed immediately and must succeed.

## End-to-End Kernel Optimization Workflows

KernelAgent includes a hardware-guided optimization pipeline that iteratively improves a verified Triton kernel's performance using GPU profiling feedback.

1. **Profile** — NCU collects 28 hardware metrics (compute utilization, memory bandwidth, cache hit rates, occupancy, stall breakdowns)
2. **Roofline Analysis** — Classifies the kernel as memory-bound, compute-bound, or underutilized based on SOL (speed-of-light) percentages
3. **Bottleneck Diagnosis** — An LLM analyzes the NCU metrics + kernel code to identify root causes and recommend specific fixes
4. **Optimization** — An LLM generates an optimized kernel applying the recommended fixes
5. **Verification** — The optimized kernel is tested for numerical correctness against PyTorch reference
6. **Benchmarking** — CUDA event timing measures the new kernel, tracking best-so-far with divergence-based revert

The loop runs for up to N rounds, with early termination when the kernel reaches roofline (≥95% SOL) or when performance converges.

## Usage

### Gradio UI

```bash
python scripts/optimization_ui.py --port 8085
```


### Programmatic API

**Optimize a kernel using beam search** — parallel exploration with top-N kernels and M bottleneck directions:
```bash
cd examples && python run_opt_manager.py \
  --kernel-dir optimize_01_matvec/ \
  --strategy beam_search \
  --max-rounds 5
```

### Key Components

| Component | Location | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **OptimizationOrchestrator** | `triton_kernel_agent/opt_worker_component/orchestrator/` | Main optimization loop |
| **KernelProfiler** | `triton_kernel_agent/opt_worker_component/profiling/` | NCU hardware profiling |
| **BottleneckAnalyzer** | `triton_kernel_agent/opt_worker_component/prescribing/` | LLM-based bottleneck diagnosis |
| **RooflineAnalyzer** | `kernel_perf_agent/kernel_opt/roofline/` | SOL classification and early stopping |
| **Benchmark** | `triton_kernel_agent/opt_worker_component/benchmarking/` | CUDA event timing |

### Optimization Artifacts

```
.optimize/workers/<worker_id>/<run_id>/artifacts
  kernel_round_0.py          # baseline kernel
  kernel_round_N.py          # kernel after round N
  round001_opt_prompt.txt    # optimization prompt sent to LLM
  round001_opt_reply.txt     # LLM response
  round001_strategy.json     # bottleneck analysis result
  ...
```

## Platform Support

KernelAgent supports multiple GPU platforms for Triton kernel execution:

| Platform | Device String | Flag | Status |
|----------|---------------|------|--------|
| NVIDIA CUDA | `cuda` | `--target-platform cuda` (default) | Fully supported |
| Intel XPU | `xpu` | `--target-platform xpu` | Supported |

### Intel XPU Notes

When targeting Intel XPU, KernelAgent automatically:
- Uses `device='xpu'` for all tensor allocations
- Applies XPU-specific Triton optimizations (subgroup sizes, block sizes)
- Generates appropriate device availability checks
- Removes CUDA-specific patterns from generated code

### Verifying Platform Setup
```python
# Check CUDA availability
import torch
print("CUDA available:", torch.cuda.is_available())

# Check XPU availability
print("XPU available:", hasattr(torch, 'xpu') and torch.xpu.is_available())
```

## Run Artifacts

A successful pipeline run yields a structure similar to:

```
.fuse/<run_id>/
  orchestrator/code.py.tgz         # fused PyTorch refactor
  subgraphs.json                   # shape-specialized subgraph descriptions
  kernels_out/
    <subgraph_id>/*                # per-subgraph KernelAgent sessions
    summary.json                   # success/failure per subgraph
  compose_out/
    composed_kernel.py             # final Triton program + self-test
    summary.json                   # composition metadata
```

These artifacts are designed for reproducibility: you can re-run a single kernel session, inspect prompts/responses, or feed `composed_kernel.py` directly into downstream tooling.
